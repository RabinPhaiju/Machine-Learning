Course Outline
INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON AND BASIC STATISTICS

Course Description

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. You can use Python when your data analysis tasks need to be integrated with web apps or if statistics code needs to be incorporated into a production database. Being a full-fledged programming language, itâ€™s a great tool to implement algorithms for production use.

While the infancy of Python packages for data analysis was an issue in the past, this has improved significantly over the years. In this course, you will learn about NumPy / Pandas (data manipulation) for data analysis and matplotlib (to make graphics). You will also learn about scikit-learn for machine learning in future courses.
