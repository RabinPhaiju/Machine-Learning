Why Python?

Python is easy to implement.
Development time is quick.
Debugging is straight forward.
Readability is emphasized.
Python is open source.
Python is not restricted to data science.


Execution of python code is slow.
Python was created for computer scientists, not data scientists.

R is a little better of you are only doing statistics work.
If you need to write broad programs, python is the clear winner.
