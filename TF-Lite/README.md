# Edge Devices

    - Phones, ardino, smart watches,micro-controllers etc.

# Edge Computing

    - Edge computing is the practice of moving compute and storage resources closer to the location at which it is needed.

# Edge ML Explosion

    - Lower Latency & close knit interactions.
    - Network connectivity.
    - Privacy preserving.

# Challenges on TF

    - Limited compute power
    - Limited memory
    - Battery consumption
    - App size

# Tensorflow lite

    - It is a production ready, cross-platform framework for deploying ML on mobile devices and embedded systems.

# Workflow

    - Train a TF model
    - convert to TF-lite format
    - Deploy and run on edge devices.
