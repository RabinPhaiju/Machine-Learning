# Hypothesis

    - An assumption about certain characteristics of a population.
    - Null hypothesis (HO) -> The hypothesis that does not challenge the status quo
    - A null hypothesis is a type of hypothesis that proposes that there is no difference between certain characteristics of a population
    - Alternative hypothesis(Ha) -> The hypothesis that challenges the status quo

# Hypothesis Testing.

> Hypothesis testing is an act in statistics whereby an analyst tests an assumption regarding a population parameter. The methodology employed by the analyst depends on the nature of the data used and the reason for the analysis.

> Hypothesis testing is used to assess the plausibility of a hypothesis by using sample data. Such data may come from a larger population, or from a data-generating process. The word "population" will be used for both of these cases in the following descriptions.

# Real-World Example of Hypothesis Testing

    If, for example, a person wants to test that a penny has exactly a 50% chance of landing on heads, the null hypothesis would be that 50% is correct, and the alternative hypothesis would be that 50% is not correct.

    Mathematically, the null hypothesis would be represented as Ho: P = 0.5. The alternative hypothesis would be denoted as "Ha" and be identical to the null hypothesis, except with the equal sign struck-through, meaning that it does not equal 50%.

    A random sample of 100 coin flips is taken, and the null hypothesis is then tested. If it is found that the 100 coin flips were distributed as 40 heads and 60 tails, the analyst would assume that a penny does not have a 50% chance of landing on heads and would reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.

    If, on the other hand, there were 48 heads and 52 tails, then it is plausible that the coin could be fair and still produce such a result. In cases such as this where the null hypothesis is "accepted," the analyst states that the difference between the expected results (50 heads and 50 tails) and the observed results (48 heads and 52 tails) is "explainable by chance alone."

# Type 1 and Type 2 error

## Type 1 Error:

    Rejection of null hypothesis, when it should not have been rejected.
    Incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis.

## Type 2 Error:

    Failure to reject the null hypothesis, when it should have been rejected.
    Incorrectly not rejecting the null hypothesis.

|  Decision/Reality |  H0 True (Shoud not reject) |     H0 False (Should reject) |
| ----------------: | --------------------------: | ---------------------------: |
|         Reject H0 |      Type 1 Error ( alpha ) | Correct Rejection (No error) |
| Fail to Reject H0 | Correct Decision (No error) |        Type 2 error ( Beta ) |

## Causes of Type 1 and Type 2 Errors.

    By random chance, we may select a sample which is not representative of the population.
    Sampling techniques may be flawed.
    Assumptions in our null hypothesis may be flawed.

# Type of Hypothesis Test.

    • Single sample or two or multiple samples
    • One tailed or two tailed
    • Tests of mean, proportion or variance
